## Why MultiFATE?

[FATE](https://fate-srd.com/) is a roleplaying system with lots of advantages:
* applicable for any setting
* flexible (and yet not overloaded) rule system
* permissive license

I've used it now for years and enjoyed it very much. Still, there are some things I'd improve.

* Even roleplaying veterans often do not have Fudge dice with them. So let's use 3d6. 
* While the rules are relatively simple compared to other systems, they are sometimes confusing. Let's simplify them even further. 
* I love [Professor DungeonMaster's idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_mxYKzEjms) of simultaneous combat. We'll take that as well.

## So what is MultiFATE?

MultiFATE is an adaption of FATE, with the above-mentioned changes.
It's my personal "homebrew", and I share it here in the hope that someone may find it (or just parts) useful.

This site only contains my adaptations.
You should definitely check out the original [Fate Core](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core) rules for the complete picture.
