## Making checks

Making a check works the same as in Fate Core:
You roll your dice, add them together and add your bonus.

However, the **bonus** you get from invoking aspects changes:
Where Fate Core gives you a +2, MultiFATE gives you a whopping +4!

Also for a **critical success** you need to be at a 5+ over the target number.

## Getting hit

Attacking/defending also works a bit different:
* Your attack is only successful, if you roll a 10 or higher.
  For rolls below 10, no defense roll is needed.
* When defending, you always have at least a 10, not matter the roll.

# For the Math geeks

Here, you find a comparison on how the rolls of Fate dice compare to the 3d6 version:
